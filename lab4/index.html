			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Pseudocode a game, preferably a simple one, and lay out the steps like you were about to program it</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Brain elasticity and figuring out actual code, where things go etc.. Both me and partner were initially confused. After banging my head against it and after class lecture I had a much better grasp of what to do.</p>
